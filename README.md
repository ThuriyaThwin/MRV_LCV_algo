# Todo

## Tyler

- [ ] Due Thursday, 02/16: Implement file parsing and constraint net
- [ ] Due Friday, 02/17: Backtracking algorithm

## Harry
- [ ] Due Thursday, 02/16: Write minimum remaining values and least-constraining-value heuristics function
    - **Minimum Remaining Values**: choosing the variable with the fewest “legal” values (page 216)
    - **Least Constraining Value**: prefers the value that rules out the fewest choices for the neighboring variables in the constraint graph (page 217, or see [this pdf](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/271fall09/CSP271fall09.pdf), slide 17)
- [ ] Due Friday, 02/17: Write forward-checking function
